### Code in Place is a free, human-centered, intro-to-coding course from Stanford University.


The Code in Place Course take the first half of CS106A, online for free, with the support from thousands of teachers.

- Who? Learners, with no programming experience, and time to dedicate to learning.
 
- Where? Anywhere with internet.
 
- What? Learn the first half of Stanford's intro to python course, CS106A.

- When? See applicatons due date on their website (https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/).
 
- Certification? Yes. Build a sharable portfolio of your code, hosted by Stanford.
 
- How much work? At least 7 hours each week for 6 weeks. There are recorded lectures that you need to watch before the on-line session (around 1 hour). After that you will need to practice and have fun trying to solve the coding challenges.

 
In this repository, I have added the coding challenges and solutions from Code in Place Course from April 2024. There are at least 5 exercises per week, starting with Karel which is a programming language and a robot that can be used to teach beginners how to program. Later, the coding challenges moved on to Python (intro, control flow, graphics and functions, and data)


The course ends with the design and submission of the final project, or at least it was like that for me. After you submit your project, finish all the lessons and key challenges you will have access to your certificate.
